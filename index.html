            <h2> My passion for horse-riding üêé </h2>
            <p>
             Horse riding is <strong>my favourite activity</strong>. I have been riding since I was 4 years old. So it's really something important for me. I have been riding for 14 years and then I entered competitions at the age of 13. I have done <strong>a lot of competitions</strong> with my competition pony, <strong>Crack de Machno</strong>. Amongst my various competitions I was lucky enough to participate twice in the French Championship and even to come <strong>7th in France in the show jumping category</strong>. It is a moment I am very proud of and I will never forget. Riding allows me to <strong>take time for myself</strong> but also <strong>to spend time with animals</strong>, which I like very much. Unfortunately I had to stop riding when I arrived in Lille, but when I go back home I always take time to ride. On this picture you can see me during a competition.

            <h2> My different trips </h2>
            <p>
             I had <strong> the opportunity to travel around the world</strong>. Indeed, with my school, we have done many school trips. I also went on trips with my family. For example I had the chance to go to the <strong>USA</strong> but also to <strong>Indonesia</strong> or <strong>South Africa</strong>. What I particularly like when I travel is the discovery of new landscapes, new cultures.But that is not all. Travelling also allows me <strong>to get out of my comfort zone</strong> and therefore <strong>to open up to the world and to others</strong>. My favourite trip is without hesitation my trip to South Africa. I was able to go on safari, meet new people and learn more about this beautiful country.
